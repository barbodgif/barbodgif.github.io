<div class="about">
  	<h1>Hi. My name is Ehsan Gifani!</h1>
	<p>I was born in Bojnord, Iran. I have studied <em>Chemical Engineering</em> at <a href="http://aut.ac.ir/aut/">Amirkabir University of Technology</a> and currently, I am pursuing a Ms degree in my this field. In the course of my undergradute studies, I was mainly engaged with computer simulation and data analysis. However, I did my Bsc thesis on Reviewing Produced Water Treatment Technologies while using and integrating facts and data from various sources including but not limited to environmental law, water and soil standards for potable and agricultural use. In my Msc studies, I am conducting research on simulation of a gene delivery system using [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/).</p>
	<p>As like every other human, I have some hobbies too. I spend my free time watching movies, programming, brainstorming ideas, going out with friends, swimming, working out and doing new things (like creating this website).</p>
	<p>My current goal is to further my studies toward a PhD degree in the interface of medicine and my field.</p>
